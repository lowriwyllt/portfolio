## Update

### 14/01/2026

I've looked at this for the first time in a good part of 2 years. This has completely made me realise how much I've grown as a dev. I'm going to be working on this portfolio once again, trying to improve what I already have and upgrade from techniques I've learnt. Some of the things I'll be looking to add:

- Add tests... oops - getting there
- Use jest axe to help test for accessability ✅
- Integrate Knip to detect unused code ✅
- Remove Firebase config; site is fully static ✅
- Consolidate styling (Tailwind CSS vs. Chakra UI vs something completely different) and migrate to one. ✅ - going to use css modules going forward
- Add linting ✅ - fixed ones
- Add workflows for PRs to run linting, testing, knip and run a build
- Complete pages that are under construction
